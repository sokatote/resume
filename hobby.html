      <h2>Hi.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I love to do a lot of things besides the love of programming. I would divide them into two categories:</p>
        <ul class="none">
            <li class="none">
                Things that were created by others - they are beautiful,<br> fascinating and harmonize with my soul
            </li>
            <li class="none">
                Things I create by myself to make my world uniq.
